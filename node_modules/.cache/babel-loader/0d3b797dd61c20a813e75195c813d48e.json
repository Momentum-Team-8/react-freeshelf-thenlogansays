A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.'\n      }\n    ])\n\n    return (\n      <main>\n        <h1>Reading List</h1>\n        {books.map((book, idx) => {\n          return (\n            <BookCard title={book.title} author={book.author} shortDescription={book.shortDescription} key={idx} id={idx} />\n          )\n        })}\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n\n  const BookCard = (props) => {\n    const { id, title, author, shortDescription } = props\n\n    return (\n      <div id={id} className='card'>\n        <h2>{title}</h2>\n        <h3>{author}</h3>\n        <p>{shortDescription}</p>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
